/* 
Oh, thank goodness you're here 🙏 As you can see below, I created a function
called myOnClickFunction. It is currently called whenever the "onclick" event fires
for the button in our button.html file.

I defined another two functions for use in the card component, but I didn't manage to
add onclick functions to the buttons in card.html... and I couldn't think of good 
messages to display when those buttons are clicked. PLEASE HELP ME OUT 😭
*/

const myOnClickFunction = () => {
  alert("Your button was clicked and called a function in script.js!");
};
const myOkClickFunction = () => {
  // what can we display for the user when OK is clicked?...
};
const myCancelClickFunction = () => {
  // what can we display for the user when Cancel is clicked?...
};
